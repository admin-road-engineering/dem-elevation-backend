{
  "version": "2.0",
  "data_collections": {
    "au_qld_z56": {
      "collection_type": "australian_utm_zone",
      "country": "AU", "utm_zone": 56,
      "files": [...], "coverage_bounds": {...}
    },
    "nz_auckland_north_2018": {
      "collection_type": "new_zealand_campaign", 
      "country": "NZ", "region": "auckland",
      "survey_name": "auckland-north", "year": 2018,
      "data_type": "DEM", "resolution_m": 1,
      "files": [...], "coverage_bounds": {...}
    }
  }
}
```

- **Fail-Fast Validation**: Configuration errors prevent startup rather than runtime failures

### Data Source Management  
- **SourceProvider Pattern**: Async data loading with FastAPI lifespan integration
- **Spatial Indexing**: O(log N) geographic lookups for performance
- **Fallback Chains**: Graceful degradation through multiple data sources

### State Management
- **Redis-First**: All shared state managed through Redis for multi-worker safety
- **Circuit Breakers**: API resilience through intelligent failure detection
- **Atomic Operations**: Race condition prevention through proper state management

## üöÄ Deployment & Infrastructure Management

### Railway Platform Integration
**Production Platform**: Railway (https://re-dem-elevation-backend.up.railway.app)  
**Authentication**: Logged in as `admin@road.engineering`  
**Project**: `road-engineering-DEM-Backend`  

#### Railway CLI Connection Process
```bash
# Check authentication status
railway whoami
# Output: Logged in as admin@road.engineering üëã

# Check project status  
railway status
# Output: Project: road-engineering-DEM-Backend
#         Environment: production
#         Service: dem-elevation-backend

# Manage environment variables
railway variables                           # List all variables
railway variables --set "KEY=value"        # Set new variable
railway variables --set "ENABLE_NZ_SOURCES=true"  # Example: Enable NZ sources
```

#### Critical Environment Variables
- `ENABLE_NZ_SOURCES=true` - Enables New Zealand S3 elevation sources
- `USE_S3_SOURCES=true` - Enables Australian S3 campaign sources  
- `SPATIAL_INDEX_SOURCE=s3` - Use S3-hosted spatial indexes
- `APP_ENV=production` - Production safety behaviors
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - S3 access credentials

### Spatial Index Management
**Automated Batch Files**: Complete spatial index generation and maintenance workflows  
**Dynamic Discovery**: All systems use dynamic S3 bucket scanning to detect new files automatically  
**Incremental Updates**: Fast detection of only new files added since last update  

#### Australian S3 Bucket Management
```bash
# Full regeneration (15-30 minutes)
scripts/generate_australian_spatial_index.bat

# Incremental update (2-5 minutes) 
scripts/update_australian_spatial_index.bat
```

#### New Zealand S3 Bucket Management  
```bash
# Full regeneration with dynamic scanning (10-20 minutes)
generate_nz_dynamic_index.bat

# Incremental update (1-3 minutes)
scripts/update_nz_spatial_index.bat
```

**Key Features:**
- **Dynamic Discovery**: No hardcoded mappings - automatically finds new files
- **Actual Bounds Extraction**: Uses GeoTIFF metadata instead of approximations  
- **Automatic Fallback**: Incremental updates fall back to full generation if needed
- **Production Integration**: Compatible with existing `upload_nz_index.py` for Railway deployment

### AWS S3 Integration Architecture
**Main Bucket**: `road-engineering-elevation-data` (Private, contains indexes)  
**NZ Data Bucket**: `nz-elevation` (Public, contains NZ DEM files)  
**Region**: `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney)  

#### S3 Bucket Structure
```
road-engineering-elevation-data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ indexes/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ spatial_index.json           # 1,153 Australian campaigns
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nz_spatial_index.json        # 16 NZ regions (1.08MB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [campaign data files...]

nz-elevation/                         # Public bucket
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auckland/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auckland-north_2016-2018/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ auckland-part-2_2024/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wellington/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ canterbury/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other NZ regions...]
```

#### AWS Connection Process
```bash
# Using environment variables from .env or Railway
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA5SIDYET7N3U4JQ5H
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[credential]
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=ap-southeast-2

# Upload spatial indexes (when needed)
python upload_nz_index.py              # Uploads NZ index to S3
python scripts/upload_indexes_to_s3.py # Uploads AU indexes to S3
```

#### S3 Access Patterns
- **Australian Data**: Private bucket access with AWS credentials
- **NZ Data**: Public bucket with unsigned access (`AWS_NO_SIGN_REQUEST=YES`)
- **Index Loading**: SourceProvider loads indexes from main bucket during startup
- **File Access**: Direct S3 access via GDAL VSI (`/vsis3/bucket/path`)

### Deployment Workflow
1. **Code Changes**: Commit and push to GitHub main branch
2. **Automatic Deploy**: Railway detects changes and redeploys  
3. **Environment Updates**: Use Railway CLI to set variables
4. **Health Verification**: Check `/api/v1/health` endpoint
5. **Performance Testing**: Validate response times for AU/NZ coordinates

This service achieves "Excellent" architecture status through systematic application of safety-first engineering, performance optimization, and operational excellence while maintaining clear separation between production requirements and development convenience.
