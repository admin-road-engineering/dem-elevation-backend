# **Railway Deployment Failure Resolution Protocol**
## Critical Issue: Railway Platform Not Deploying Code Changes

**Current Status**: Production service frozen on deployment from 8:43 PM (4+ hours old)  
**Impact**: All endpoints returning null elevations with 0 collections available  
**Root Issue**: Railway deployment pipeline completely non-functional

---

## **Phase 1: Diagnosis & Hypothesis**

### 1.1 **Problem Statement**
**Symptoms**:
- Railway has not deployed any code changes since 8:43 PM (uptime: 14,167+ seconds)
- Service stuck using `indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2_ideal.json` (wrong file)
- Collections available: 0 (should be 1,582)
- Multiple git pushes (5+ commits) have not triggered deployments
- Manual `railway up` command initiated but deployment never completed
- All elevation endpoints return null values

**Expected Behavior**: 
- Git pushes should trigger automatic Railway deployments
- Service should load `indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2.json` with 1,582 collections
- Elevation endpoints should return actual elevation values

### 1.2 **Evidence Gathering**
**Current Service State**:
```json
{
  "uptime_seconds": 14167,
  "unified_index_path": "indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2_ideal.json",
  "collections_available": 0,
  "status": "healthy"  // False positive - service non-functional
}
```

**S3 Index Files Available**:
- ✅ `indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2.json` (411MB, 1,582 collections) - **CORRECT FILE**
- ❌ `indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2_ideal.json` (374MB, 3 campaigns only) - **WRONG FILE**

### 1.3 **Root Cause Hypothesis**
**Primary Hypothesis**: Railway deployment pipeline is blocked/failing silently
- Build failures not being reported
- Deployment stuck in queue
- Railway platform issues preventing new deployments

**Secondary Issue**: Environment variable corruption
- `UNIFIED_INDEX_PATH` reverts to incomplete value `"indexes/"`
- Railway CLI environment variable updates not persisting

---

## **Phase 2: Solution Design & Verification**

### 2.1 **Immediate Recovery Strategy (P0 - Critical)**

#### **Option A: Force Manual Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Check deployment status
railway status

# 2. Force redeploy with explicit confirmation
echo "y" | railway redeploy

# 3. If blocked, use alternative deployment
railway up --detach
```

#### **Option B: Direct Environment Variable Override**
```bash
# Set correct index path directly
railway variables --set "UNIFIED_INDEX_PATH=indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2.json"

# Force service restart
railway restart
```

#### **Option C: Railway Platform Recovery**
```bash
# 1. Check for stuck deployments
railway deployments

# 2. Cancel/remove stuck deployments
railway down  # Remove most recent deployment

# 3. Fresh deployment
railway up
```

### 2.2 **Code-Level Bypass (P0 - Critical)**

#### **Hardcode Correct Index Path**
**File**: `src/providers/unified_elevation_provider.py`
```python
# Line 80-81: Override environment variable completely
correct_index_path = "indexes/unified_spatial_index_v2.json"  # Hardcoded bypass
logger.critical(f"FORCING correct index: {correct_index_path}")
```

#### **Add Deployment Health Check**
**File**: `src/main.py`
```python
# Add deployment verification on startup
if unified_provider.collections_available == 0:
    logger.critical("DEPLOYMENT FAILURE: Zero collections loaded")
    # Send alert/notification
    raise SystemExit(1)  # Force restart
```

---

## **Phase 3: Implementation & Validation Plan**

### 3.1 **Step-by-Step Recovery Process**

#### **Step 1: Platform Diagnostics**
```bash
# Check Railway platform status
railway status
railway deployments --limit 5

# Check build logs if available
railway logs --build
```

#### **Step 2: Clear Deployment Pipeline**
```bash
# Remove stuck deployments
railway down

# Clear Railway cache (if command exists)
railway cache clear
```

#### **Step 3: Manual Deployment with Monitoring**
```bash
# Deploy with verbose output
railway up --verbose

# Monitor deployment progress
railway logs --follow
```

#### **Step 4: Verification Tests**
```bash
# Health check - MUST show collections > 0
curl "https://re-dem-elevation-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/health"

# Critical coordinates test
curl "https://re-dem-elevation-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/elevation?lat=-27.4698&lon=153.0251"
# Expected: Brisbane ~10.87m

curl "https://re-dem-elevation-backend.up.railway.app/api/v1/elevation?lat=-36.8485&lon=174.7633"
# Expected: Auckland ~25.0m
```

### 3.2 **Alternative Recovery Paths**

#### **Path A: Railway Web Console**
1. Login to Railway web dashboard
2. Navigate to project: `road-engineering-DEM-Backend`
3. Check deployment logs for error messages
4. Manually trigger redeploy from web UI
5. Monitor deployment progress in real-time

#### **Path B: GitHub Integration Reset**
1. Check GitHub webhook status
2. Disconnect and reconnect GitHub integration
3. Verify webhook triggers on push
4. Test with empty commit

#### **Path C: Environment Migration**
1. Create new Railway environment
2. Copy environment variables
3. Deploy to new environment
4. Switch production domain

## **Phase 4: Validation & Prevention**

### 4.1 **Success Criteria**
- [ ] Health endpoint shows `collections_available > 1500`
- [ ] Brisbane coordinate returns ~10.87m elevation
- [ ] Auckland coordinate returns ~25.0m elevation
- [ ] All 6 endpoint types return valid JSON responses
- [ ] No `NoneType` iteration errors

### 4.2 **Monitoring & Alerts**
```python
# Add deployment monitoring
if app.state.unified_provider.collections_available == 0:
    send_alert("CRITICAL: DEM service has 0 collections")
    
# Add uptime monitoring
if uptime_seconds > 86400:  # 24 hours
    send_alert("WARNING: Service not redeployed in 24 hours")
```

### 4.3 **Prevention Measures**
1. **Deployment Health Checks**: Add pre-deployment validation
2. **Environment Audit**: Regular checks of critical variables
3. **Fail-Fast on Bad Config**: Service refuses to start with 0 collections
4. **Deployment Notifications**: Alert on deployment failures
5. **Rollback Strategy**: Automatic rollback on health check failure

---

## **Phase 5: Escalation Path**

### 5.1 **If Railway Platform Unresponsive**
1. Contact Railway support
2. Check Railway status page: https://railway.app/status
3. Consider temporary migration to alternative platform

### 5.2 **Emergency Mitigation**
1. Deploy to backup environment
2. Update DNS to point to backup
3. Implement local Docker deployment as fallback

---

## **Immediate Actions Required**

### **Priority 1: Force Deployment (Next 15 minutes)**
1. Execute `railway down` to clear stuck deployment
2. Execute `railway up --verbose` for fresh deployment
3. Monitor logs with `railway logs --follow`

### **Priority 2: Verify Recovery (Next 30 minutes)**
1. Check health endpoint for collections > 0
2. Test critical coordinates
3. Validate all endpoint types

### **Priority 3: Implement Safeguards (Next hour)**
1. Add deployment health checks
2. Implement fail-fast on bad configuration
3. Set up monitoring alerts

---

## **Root Cause Analysis Summary**

**Confirmed Issues**:
1. Railway deployment pipeline completely blocked
2. Environment variable not updating properly
3. Service using wrong index file (v2_ideal instead of v2)
4. No deployment in 4+ hours despite multiple attempts

**Likely Causes**:
1. Railway platform issue/outage
2. Build process failing silently
3. GitHub webhook disconnection
4. Deployment queue corruption

**Solution**: Multi-pronged approach combining platform recovery, code bypasses, and monitoring to ensure service restoration and prevent recurrence.
