# Conversation History

## Initial Setup and Cleanup
- Reviewed root directory contents and identified files to clean up.
- Simplified startup scripts from 7 to 2.
- Archived redundant scripts to archived-files/redundant-scripts/.

## Model Selection
- Set model to sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-20250514).

## API Testing Plan Creation
- Created a plan to test the APIs and list connected APIs and S3 accounts.
- Analyzed codebase for API and S3 connections.
- Reviewed environment configurations (.env.api-test, .env.production, .env.local).
- Created test_api_plan.py for comprehensive testing.
- Documented external connections in docs/API_TESTING_PLAN.md.

## API Testing Instructions
- Wrote API_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md with step-by-step testing guide.
- Provided quick task list for local, API, production, and live testing.

## Senior Engineer Review Implementation
- Received comprehensive review feedback on API_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Identified gaps: High-res S3 bucket, batch testing, local validation, authentication depth
- Implemented recommended updates:
  * Added high-res S3 bucket testing throughout
  * Enhanced batch elevation testing (GPXZ API and DEM Backend)
  * Added local DEM file validation step
  * Included specific expected values (Brisbane ~45m, Sydney ~25m)
  * Added fallback behavior debugging commands
  * Enhanced troubleshooting with check_available_dems.py

## Document Updates Applied
- Updated API_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md with all senior engineer recommendations
- Added validation for AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME_HIGH_RES configuration
- Enhanced manual testing commands with batch request examples
- Improved expected results with specific elevation values for reproducibility
- Added debugging commands for fallback behavior and DEM availability
