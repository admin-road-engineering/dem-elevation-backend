# Health Check Debug Analysis

Following debugging protocol for Railway health check failures.

## Problem Statement
- **Issue**: Railway health check fails with "service unavailable" after 240s
- **Status**: Service starts successfully (logs show "Application startup complete")
- **Impact**: Deployment fails despite functional application

## Phase 1: Diagnosis Results

### Evidence Collected
1. **Service Startup**: ✅ Successful ("Built unified DEM_SOURCES: 1153 total sources")
2. **Health Endpoint Performance**: ✅ 0.00ms response time (tested locally)
3. **Railway Logs**: ❌ "service unavailable" for 240s, then timeout
4. **Container**: ✅ Built successfully with Docker

### Performance Test Results
```
Health check endpoint: 0.00ms response time
get_dem_sources(): 0.00ms (1,153 sources)
Railway timeout: 240,000ms vs actual: ~0ms
Conclusion: Health endpoint is NOT the bottleneck
```

## Root Cause Hypothesis

**PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS: Port Configuration Mismatch**

Railway likely assigns a dynamic `$PORT` environment variable, but our service is hardcoded to port 8001:

- **Dockerfile CMD**: `--port 8001` (hardcoded)
- **Railway startCommand**: `--port 8001` (hardcoded)  
- **Railway expectation**: Service binds to `$PORT` (dynamic)

**Result**: Railway health check connects to assigned port (e.g., 3000) but service listens on 8001.

### Supporting Evidence
1. Railway reports "service unavailable" (connection refused) not "timeout" 
2. Multiple immediate failures suggest routing/connection issue, not performance
3. Service starts successfully but Railway can't reach it
4. Common Railway deployment pattern requires `$PORT` environment variable

## Proposed Solution

**Option 1: Use Railway's Dynamic Port (Recommended)**
```bash
# Railway startCommand
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

**Option 2: Configure Railway for Fixed Port**
- Set Railway environment variable `PORT=8001`
- Keep existing hardcoded port configuration

## Implementation Plan

1. **Test Port Theory**: Update startCommand to use `$PORT`
2. **Validate**: Deploy and confirm health check passes
3. **Regression Test**: Add test to verify service responds on correct port
4. **Document**: Update Railway configuration documentation

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Port configuration change is minimal and reversible
- **High Confidence**: Port mismatch is common Railway deployment issue
- **Fallback**: Can revert to hardcoded port with Railway PORT=8001 env var
