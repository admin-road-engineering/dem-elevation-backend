# Coordinate Testing Results

## ✅ Successfully Tested Coordinates

### New Zealand 🇳🇿
| Location | Coordinates | Elevation | Source | Processing Time |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Auckland Harbor** | (-36.8485, 174.7633) | **25.0m** | BA32_10000_0401.tiff | ~5,850ms |
| **Near Auckland** | (-36.8500, 174.7700) | **40.9m** | BA32_10000_0401.tiff | ~4,909ms |
| **Wellington** | (-41.2865, 174.7762) | **2.66m** | BQ31.tiff | ~68,213ms |

### Australia 🇦🇺  
| Location | Coordinates | Elevation | Source | Processing Time |
|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Brisbane CBD** | (-27.4698, 153.0251) | **10.87m** | Brisbane_2019_Prj_SW_502000_6961000_1k_DEM_1m.tif | ~3,188ms |
| **Near Brisbane** | (-27.4700, 153.0300) | **4.52m** | Brisbane_2019_Prj_SW_502000_6961000_1k_DEM_1m.tif | ~2,004ms |

## ❌ No Data Available

### Australia 🇦🇺
- **Sydney Harbor** (-33.8688, 151.2093): No elevation data (~12,435ms)
- **Melbourne CBD** (-37.8136, 144.9631): No elevation data (~8,307ms)

### New Zealand 🇳🇿  
- **Christchurch** (-43.5321, 172.6362): No elevation data (~11ms)

## 📊 Analysis

### ✅ Working Areas
- **Auckland Region, NZ**: Excellent coverage with BA32_10000_0401.tiff providing accurate elevations
- **Wellington, NZ**: Coverage available via BQ31.tiff (though slower processing)
- **Brisbane Region, AU**: Excellent coverage with Brisbane 2019 campaign providing fast, accurate results

### ❌ Coverage Gaps
- **Sydney, AU**: No collections found despite being a major city
- **Melbourne, AU**: No collections found despite being a major city  
- **Christchurch, NZ**: No collections found (very fast failure suggests bounds check failure)

### ⚡ Performance Insights
- **Fastest responses**: Brisbane area (~2-3 seconds)
- **Moderate responses**: Auckland area (~5-6 seconds)
- **Slower responses**: Wellington (~68 seconds - needs investigation)
- **Failed requests**: Fast failures (<1s) suggest bounds check issues

### 🎯 Data Source Patterns
- **NZ Sources**: Using s3://nz-elevation bucket with individual campaign files (BA32_*.tiff, BQ31.tiff)
- **AU Sources**: Using Brisbane 2019 campaign with systematic file naming
- **Coverage**: Bi-national coverage confirmed, but limited to specific regional campaigns

## 🚀 Service Status: **OPERATIONAL**

### Core Functionality: ✅ WORKING
- Auckland, NZ: ✅ 25.0m elevation
- Brisbane, AU: ✅ 10.87m elevation
- Bi-national coverage: ✅ Confirmed
- Unified architecture: ✅ Operating correctly

### Coverage Expansion Opportunities:
- Add Sydney/Melbourne AU campaigns
- Expand NZ coverage beyond Auckland/Wellington
- Investigate Christchurch bounds issue
- Optimize Wellington processing time (68s)

**Conclusion**: The elevation service is fully operational for primary test coordinates and demonstrates successful bi-national coverage. Additional regional campaigns could expand coverage to major cities currently without data.
